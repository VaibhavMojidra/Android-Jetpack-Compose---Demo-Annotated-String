# Android Jetpack Compose Demo Annotated String

**AnnotatedString** is a powerful tool provided by Android Jetpack Compose for creating and formatting text. It is a string that has additional metadata attached to segments of its text. This metadata can be used to apply rich formatting to parts of the string, such as changing the color, font, or style of certain sections, or adding hyperlinks or custom actions.
